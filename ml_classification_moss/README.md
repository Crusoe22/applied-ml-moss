# Titanic Dataset Project: Predicting Survival Outcomes

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. In this project, I explore the Titanic dataset to analyze passenger data and build machine learning models that predict survival outcomes. The dataset contains a variety of features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more, which provide insights into who was more likely to survive.

Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests, this project aims to uncover patterns in the data and evaluate model performance.

### Set up the virtual environment in the terminal:
``` shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual enivronment
``` shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements
``` shell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
