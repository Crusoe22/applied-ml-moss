The notebook is well-structured and easy to follow, even at first glance. The selected features—odor and bruises—are excellent choices for determining whether a mushroom is poisonous or not. The results and model comparisons are clearly explained, with strong reporting that led to very high prediction accuracy. The insights presented are thoughtful and well-articulated. The authors correctly noted that the Random Forest model performed better, likely due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships within the data. This dataset contains several strong features for classification, and I believe that cap color could also be a valuable addition. Given the high accuracy scores, there is a possibility of overfitting to the training data, which would be worth investigating further.
